# Sentiment_Analysis_using_NLP

Project Overview: Sentiment Analysis using NLP 

Our solution was designed to analyze and interpret textual data to determine its sentiment—positive, negative, or neutral. Here's a breakdown of the components:

1️⃣ NLP Models Utilized: -VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): A rule-based model, ideal for social media text, VADER performed sentiment scoring for shorter, informal texts like tweets, reviews, or comments. -RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach): For more nuanced, context-heavy sentiment analysis, we incorporated RoBERTa, a transformer-based language model fine-tuned for sentiment classification tasks. This model ensured high accuracy and deeper contextual understanding.

2️⃣ Multilingual Language Translation Feature: Powered by Google Translation API, enabling sentiment analysis across languages by translating text to English before processing.

🔹 Features That Made Our Solution Stand Out: -Hybrid Sentiment Analysis Engine: VADER: Quick and efficient for short, informal texts. RoBERTa: Transformer-based model for deeper, context-aware sentiment analysis. -Multilingual Support: Powered by Google Translation API, enabling sentiment analysis across languages by translating text to English before processing. -Real-Time Insights: Outputs with confidence scores, ideal for applications like social media tracking and feedback analysis.

🔹 Technical Stack: Python for building and integrating the models. NLP Libraries: NLTK (for VADER), Hugging Face Transformers (for RoBERTa). APIs: Google Translation API for multilingual support. Flask Framework: To create a basic web interface for testing the system.

🔹 Challenges & Takeaways: We overcame tight time constraints, optimized model integration, and ensured translation accuracy—all while collaborating effectively under pressure. This hackathon taught me the importance of teamwork, rapid problem-solving, and the potential of NLP in building impactful solutions. A big thanks to my teammates and the organizers for this incredible experience! Ready to refine this project and explore its real-world applications. 🌍 Team members: Vijay, Adithiyaa, Lakshhmi, Rishika.
